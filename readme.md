Discoard bot that keeps count of current numbers of face shields in each person's possession until the next drop.

To create a Discord Bot, see this: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html

Give the bot these permissions:

* VIEW_CHANNEL
* SEND_MESSAGES
* MANAGE_MESSAGES
* EMBED_LINKS
* READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY

To invite this bot into a Discord server (guild):

* Create a channel for the bot to monitor. Call it, for instance #bot-inventory.

* Create a role for users who can issue 'sudo' commands to the bot. Call it, for instance 'botadmin'.

* Create a role for users who can collect printed items from other makers. Call it, for instance 'collector'.

Get a bot invitation URL from the OAuth2 tab of the bot page. Click on it to invite the bot into this server.

* Choose a server
* You will be asked to confirm roles. Leave the 5 roles you chose earlier as they are.
